# falcon-task-management-API
We create a task management API with Falcon framework where users can create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks with task support and tips from AI. We'll also include validation and error handling.

# Runing
To run the Falcon API, use the following command:

`gunicorn server:StandaloneApplication`

# Testing
Test using curl or Postman by sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the appropriate endpoints (/tasks, /tasks/{task_id}).

Certainly! Here's an example of a sample `curl` command to test the endpoints of the Falcon API for task management:

## Create a Task (POST request):

`curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Sample Task", "description": "This is a sample task description."}'`

This `curl` command sends a POST request to create a new task with the title "Sample Task" and the specified description.

## Retrieve All Tasks (GET request):

`curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks`

This `curl` command sends a GET request to retrieve all tasks.

## Retrieve a Specific Task (GET request with task_id):


`curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/{task_id}`

This `curl` command sends a GET request to retrieve a specific task by its ID.

## Update a Task (PUT request with task_id):


`curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/{task_id} -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Task Title", "description": "Updated task description."}'`

This `curl` command sends a PUT request to update a specific task with the new title and description.

## Delete a Task (DELETE request with task_id):


`curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/{task_id}`

This `curl` command sends a DELETE request to delete a specific task by its ID.

Replace `{task_id}` with the actual ID of the task you want to interact with when testing the specific endpoints.


# Future updates
Add authentication, data persistence with databases, logging, and error handling.
